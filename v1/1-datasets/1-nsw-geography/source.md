No readily available resources were found to assign different suburbs to each of the 15 Local 
Health Districts (LHDs) specified by NSW Health. There was, however, a map available showing
the geographic areas that each LHD covered.

This map was adapted by adding pins to represent each of the Air Quality Recording Sites 
used by Air Quality NSW. The exported data identifies the following:
- Longitude and Latitude of Air Quality Recording Site.
- Name of the Air Quality Recording site.
- Name of the LHD the site belongs to.

The map provided a visual representation of how data is distributed across geographic
regions. The Air Quality Recording Sites are more prevalent in more highly populated areas, which
tend to be located closer together and located closer to the coastline. Additionally, there are
discrepancies in the size of each LHD, and how many recording sites are located within them. Some
LHDs contain no Air Quality Recording Sites, and will need to be excluded for them analysis.
